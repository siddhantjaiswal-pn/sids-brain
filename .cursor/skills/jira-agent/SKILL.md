# Create Jira Ticket

Focused workflow for creating a new HIS project ticket as a child of an Epic.

**Cloud ID**: `horizonpennymac.atlassian.net` | **Project**: `HIS`

---

## Domain Context

Before writing any ticket content, read [`admin-config.md`](admin-config.md) in this skill's directory. It describes the Vesta Loan Origination System — Objectives, Tasks, Automated Actions, Validations, Loan Stages, and related concepts.

Use this context to interpret shorthand in the user's summaries and action items. For example:

- "objective not opening" → the objective's Readiness condition is not being met, or it is being suppressed
- "task not triggering" → the parent objective is not Open, or the task's Relevance condition is not met
- "Escalated status" → an objective status value that should suppress further opening
- "funds ordered date" → a date field on the loan controlled by task logic
- "wire sweep time" → cutoff time logic in an instruction task within the objective
- "Exhibit A / Security Instrument" → a document type reviewed by a task in the objective

When writing the **Summary paragraph** and **Acceptance Criteria**, use correct Vesta terminology (Objective, Task, Readiness, Relevance, Automated Action, etc.) rather than generic language.

---

## Step 1: Gather Information

Collect all of the following in a single ask (batch your questions):

1. **Epic parent** — ticket ID (e.g. `HIS-498`). Validate it exists with `getJiraIssue`.
2. **Ticket type** — Story or Bug? Always ask explicitly, never assume.
3. **Summary** — concise title.
4. **Description** — what the ticket is about (raw input is fine, polish it before writing).
5. **Sprint** — only ask if user brings it up.
6. **Story Points** — auto-calculated from action item count (see Story Points Rule below). Only override if the user explicitly provides a value.

**Polish all user input** before writing to Jira: rewrite into clear, professional language at an easy-to-medium reading level. Do not confirm the polished version unless meaning is ambiguous.

### Story Points Rule (Stories only)

Auto-calculate story points from the number of action items provided:

| Action Items | Story Points |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| 1 (and description looks straightforward) | 2 |
| 2 | 3 |
| 3–4 | 5 |
| 5+ | **Ask the user** — do not proceed until confirmed |

Always include `customfield_10032` in `additional_fields` when creating a Story. If the user explicitly provides a story point value, use that instead.

## Step 2: Confirm Before Creating

Show a preview and wait for explicit confirmation:

```
Ticket to create:
  Project:      [HIS / BTX / …]
  Type:         Story
  Parent Epic:  [Epic title]
  Summary:      [polished summary]
  Description:  [first 200 chars of polished description…]
  [Project-specific required fields at their defaults]
  Assignee:     Siddhant Jaiswal
  Sprint:       Not set
  Story Points: [auto-calculated value, or "Pending — confirm with user" if 5+ action items]
```

If user wants changes, update and re-confirm before proceeding.

## Step 3: Create the Ticket

### Project-specific required fields

Each project has different required `additional_fields`. Use the correct defaults based on the parent Epic's project key.

#### HIS (Horizon Internal Services)

```
createJiraIssue(
  cloudId            = "horizonpennymac.atlassian.net",
  projectKey         = "HIS",
  issueTypeName      = "Story",          // or "Bug"
  summary            = "<polished>",
  description        = "<polished>",
  parent             = "HIS-498",
  assignee_account_id = "712020:4ddaaf98-60fb-4b88-8366-1ccb9c511a27",
  additional_fields  = {
    "customfield_10035": [{"value": "CDL", "id": "10022"}],
    "customfield_10036": {"value": "Horizon Internal Services", "id": "10024"},
    "customfield_10037": [{"value": "Eligibles", "id": "10273"}]
  },
  contentFormat = "markdown"
)
```

#### BTX (Business Transformation Execution)

```
createJiraIssue(
  cloudId            = "horizonpennymac.atlassian.net",
  projectKey         = "BTX",
  issueTypeName      = "Story",          // or "Bug"
  summary            = "<polished>",
  description        = "<polished>",
  parent             = "BTX-1",
  assignee_account_id = "712020:4ddaaf98-60fb-4b88-8366-1ccb9c511a27",
  additional_fields  = {
    "customfield_10104": [{"value": "Pennymac", "id": "10132"}],
    "customfield_10036": {"value": "AI: Agent Implementation", "id": "10770"},
    "customfield_10037": [{"value": "BT Core", "id": "10803"}]
  },
  contentFormat = "markdown"
)
```

BTX required fields reference:

| Field             | Field ID            | Default Value              | Default ID |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------- |
| Responsible Party | `customfield_10104` | `Pennymac`                 | `10132`    |
| Work-Stream       | `customfield_10036` | `AI: Agent Implementation` | `10770`    |
| Teams             | `customfield_10037` | `BT Core`                  | `10803`    |

Add to `additional_fields` for Stories (Story Points always included; Sprint only when user specifies):

| Field        | Field ID            | Format                  | When to include |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------- |
| Story Points | `customfield_10032` | `<number>`              | Always for Stories — use auto-calculated value |
| Sprint       | `customfield_10020` | `{"id": "<sprint_id>"}` | Only when user specifies |

## Step 4: Apply Description Template

After creation, update description with `editJiraIssue` using `contentFormat: "adf"`.

### Story Description Template

Three panels in description — see [templates/story-adf.md](templates/story-adf.md) for full ADF.

Structure:

1. Purple `note` panel → **Summary** heading + paragraph with a synthesized summary (see below)
2. Purple `note` panel → **Process Version to be merged to Release Candidate** heading + paragraph with `SJ-<TICKET_ID>-01`
3. Blue `info` panel → **Action Items** heading + numbered list of all polished action items provided by the user

**Summary paragraph rule**: Do NOT use the raw description. Instead, read all action items the user provided and write a single synthesized sentence (or two at most) that captures the full scope of the work. Example: if the action items are (1) suppress objective when Escalated, (2) adjust Funds Ordered Date for non-business days, (3) verify Exhibit A is not blank — the summary would be: "Enhance the Agent Funding Review objective with Escalated status suppression, non-business day Funds Ordered Date handling, and Exhibit A Security Instrument blank verification."

**Action Items list rule**: Render each action item as a numbered list item (`orderedList`) in the paragraph after the Action Items panel. Never leave action items as `[To be filled in]` when they have been provided by the user.

Then update `customfield_10058` (Acceptance Criteria) — write numbered Gherkin ACs derived from the action items (see Acceptance Criteria rule below). See [templates/story-adf.md](templates/story-adf.md).

**Process Version format**: `SJ-<TICKET_ID>-<ITERATION>` — always start with `01` for new tickets.
Example: ticket `HIS-9000` → `SJ-HIS-9000-01`

### Bug Description Template

Mixed panel types — all h1 headings use an `underline` mark. See [templates/bug-adf.md](templates/bug-adf.md) for full ADF.

1. Bare `heading` (no panel) → **Issue Description** (underlined h1) + paragraph with polished description
2. Blue `info` panel → **Steps to Reproduce** (underlined h1) + orderedList `_[To be filled in]_`
3. Green `success` panel → **Expected Results** (underlined h1) + paragraph `_[To be filled in]_`
4. Yellow `warning` panel → **Actual Results** (underlined h1) + paragraph `_[To be filled in]_`
5. Purple `note` panel → **Test Data** (underlined h1) + paragraph `_[To be filled in]_`

Bugs do NOT have Acceptance Criteria.

### Update Calls

```
editJiraIssue(
  cloudId      = "horizonpennymac.atlassian.net",
  issueIdOrKey = "<new-ticket-id>",
  fields       = { "description": <ADF doc> },
  contentFormat = "adf"
)
```

For Story only — second call for Acceptance Criteria:

```
editJiraIssue(
  cloudId      = "horizonpennymac.atlassian.net",
  issueIdOrKey = "<new-ticket-id>",
  fields       = { "customfield_10058": <ADF doc> },
  contentFormat = "adf"
)
```

### Acceptance Criteria ADF rules (Stories only)

Derive one AC per action item provided by the user. Write each in Gherkin Given/When/Then format.

ADF layout:

1. Green `success` panel → **Acceptance Criteria** heading (H1). Nothing else inside the panel.
2. Outside the panel, for each AC:
   - A `paragraph` with the AC title in **bold**: `AC-N: [title]`
   - A `paragraph` with Gherkin steps: `Given`, `When`, `Then`, `And` keywords in **bold**, step body in plain text, `hardBreak` between each line.
   - A `rule` (horizontal divider) between ACs — omit after the last one.

Never write `[To be filled in]` for Acceptance Criteria when action items have been provided. Always generate real Gherkin ACs from the action items.

---

## Adding Action Items to an Existing Ticket

When the user provides **additional action items** for a ticket that already exists (e.g. "add 2 more items"):

### Step A: Fetch the current ticket

Call `getJiraIssue` to retrieve:

- The current description (to read existing action items)
- The current `customfield_10058` (to read existing ACs and determine the highest AC number)

### Step B: Build the updated state

- **Existing action items** — parse from the current description's Action Items list
- **New action items** — the items the user just provided, polished
- **All action items** = existing + new (combined, in order)
- **Next AC number** — highest existing AC-N + 1

### Step C: Write two updates in parallel

**Description update** (`editJiraIssue` → `description`):

- Re-synthesize the **Summary paragraph** from ALL action items (existing + new)
- Keep the Process Version paragraph unchanged
- Rewrite the Action Items list with ALL items (existing + new, renumbered)

**Acceptance Criteria update** (`editJiraIssue` → `customfield_10058`):

- **Append** new Gherkin ACs for each new action item only — do NOT rewrite existing ACs
- New ACs are numbered starting from the next AC number (e.g. if existing has AC-1 through AC-3, new ones start at AC-4)
- Preserve all existing AC content exactly as-is
- Add a `rule` divider before each new AC (including before the first new one, since it follows existing content)

### Step D: Report result

```
✅ Updated: [TICKET-ID]
   Link: https://horizonpennymac.atlassian.net/browse/[TICKET-ID]

   Description updated:
   - Summary re-synthesized ([total N] action items)
   - Action Items list updated ([N existing] + [N new] = [total N] items)

   Acceptance Criteria appended:
   - AC-[N] through AC-[M] added ([N new] new ACs)
   - Existing AC-1 through AC-[N-1] unchanged
```

## Step 5: Report Result

```
✅ Ticket Created: HIS-9001
   Summary: [summary]
   Type: Story
   Parent: HIS-498 ([Epic title])
   Link: https://horizonpennymac.atlassian.net/browse/HIS-9001

   Fields Set:
   - Channel: CDL | Work-Stream: Horizon Internal Services | Teams: Eligibles
   - Assignee: Siddhant Jaiswal
   - Story Points: [N]

   Template Applied:
   - Summary section (synthesized from action items)
   - Process Version: SJ-HIS-9001-01
   - Action Items ([N] items written)
   - Acceptance Criteria ([N] ACs written — AC-1 through AC-N)
```

## Rules

- **Always confirm** before calling `createJiraIssue`
- **Never comment** on newly created tickets
- **Never edit** the parent Epic — read it only for context
- **Never make any updates** to parent tickets or Epics — they are strictly read-only
- **Never fetch any other tickets from an Epic** — only fetch the single ticket ID explicitly provided by the user; do not retrieve siblings, children, or any other linked issues
- **ADF only** for description updates — never wiki markup or markdown
- Defaults (Channel, Work-Stream, Teams, Responsible Party, Assignee) apply per project unless user explicitly overrides
- Determine the project key from the parent Epic's key prefix (e.g. `BTX-1` → BTX, `HIS-498` → HIS) and apply that project's required fields
